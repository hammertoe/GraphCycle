    Google was founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students 
    at Stanford University in California. The company's rapid growth since incorporation has 
    triggered a chain of products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine.
    Google is now a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., which was created in 2015 as part of a corporate 
    restructuring. Sundar Pichai became the CEO of Google in 2015.
